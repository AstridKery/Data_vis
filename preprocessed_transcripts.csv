And it makes me feel so uncomfortable. Because, I'm just like, ""Lighten up, dude, I just wanna just study. That wasn't what I was trying to do here.""

So, that kind of leaves me so I have a few…so, like, of my female colleagues who like to study together, the other thing that happens is like if they're commuters or not. So, commuters tend to study by themselves more so than people who live on campus.

And I know a couple of people also who have just like, exams, and just, it’s a flop for them. So, honestly, I still haven't come to the like bottom line or what the solution is to all this, but I don't know, it's just it's such a huge problem for me and like a bunch of people.

It's not always like that, but like I said, a lot of people commute. So living on campus and as commuters, it's hard for us to all get together.

But they've shown us in the work world, there are going to be times where it's like, ""Why would you go and waste the company's time doing this when you could go Google something, find a solution that's there?"" Especially if it's something simple like that. They address that and it's always been amazing to me that that's not there. But then the ethics mostly taught us to speak up if we see that there’s something going wrong. But yeah. They don't go into too much detail on, I think, gender, class, race things.

I think it would be good if the college could maybe have a few projects that simulate a work environment more just so students can have an idea what it's like.

243,Betty,CompE,female,Senior,No,NEG," I think for also going back to that question of how to make it more welcoming, as far as CompE, these teachers have to figure out something.

This hasn't happened in so long,"" moment. So when I went in, knew what I was doing, got an A, and I was like, ""Okay."" And usually, I go in, feel like I know what I'm doing, come out going, ""I don't know what that was."" So I feel like if they just…there's some disconnection between the material we're learning, the material we're doing as homework and the material that's on an exam.

Even though professors kind of stress in the beginning, ""Oh, you can come to my office hours whenever."" It would be nice if they reminded you a little more because I know some people might be hesitant. But I notice a lot of teachers are really willing to help when you go. But for some students that…and a lot of…some of us can be a little nervous to go ask or whatnot. If they really just kept stressing or maybe did take a little more initiative, seeing if someone's confused in class. Because sometimes they’re like, ""You look so confused."" And sometimes it's like, ""Okay. Well, thank you for pointing it out."" But it'd be nice for them to make that initiative to be like, ""Well, why don't you come?"" Just something.

It sounded condescending but, I don't know, it may be because it's a grad student and they only see it through their perspective, and their background in CS, of course, is completely different from everybody else in the classroom. So that may have affected the results.

When I was in high school, I was very driven to just focus on my class work, everything I had to do, so I can, you know, set myself up well for college. And that is still the case where I push myself and I want to do my best because I want to go to grad school as well. And I mean, it's just my work ethic, I would say, mainly.

286,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,POS," Mm-hmm. I would say a lot of…well, maybe a factor that can mitigate the challenges that women face is the amount of exposure they get to the field. And it's just the communication between others in the field. So, the more that they interact with people, again, it can play a role I would say because I'm a believer that environment affects you more than genetics, so just as an example. But I would say, yeah, communication is a big aspect into what people perceive, so they learn from what they hear from others.

287,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEG," It's probably about views about the major itself where there's certain stereotypes where you have to be this way or you have to be, let's say person who like, ""Oh, you don't have to have a social life, you have to just code all the time.""

288,Joe,CompS,male,Freshman,No,NEG," Yeah, it's the misconceptions now because if all people know or think that CS is about programming, they're wrong because there's a lot of other things that are in the field.

",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False
289,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEU," I would say, yes and no. Yes, because typically more men take on this sense of, they're better at technology. And so, they jump into computing, math, science, physics, all that, that's…

290,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEG," There may be a gender thing. And for women, they probably feel the same way, that they're better at other things than others and yeah, that's a gender role thing.

And it's also because they… so there's a lack of resources and maybe there's just not enough interest so that pushes people to other things. 
",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False
291,Joe,CompS,male,Freshman,No,NEU," Fallen, yeah, because of the collaboration thing. It's usually like, if someone needs help with a part of a project or something, I'd probably just answer the questions and then just go back to coding on my own. If there's like an exam coming up then we would do a study group but there's no consistent study group because of how the content is for 201 and 202. 
",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
292,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEU," Yes, for some aspects, yes. Because take projects from 202 or 341, for example, they're usually consistent. Classes share the projects and so, not for plagiarism’s sake, but collaboration involves, well in that case, it would involve getting together with a few of your peers and then trying to solve this problem together. Different perspectives can help because one person may be stuck on one part and another person figured it out, simple example. 
",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
293,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,POS," Because I know real software engineers actually work in teams, they're not isolated, they're actually encouraged to work together. And I would say, the courses here try to help build those skills. And it's not just for programming, it's actually for other classes as well. So, I know the programming languages class. That's more of a conceptual class more than programming so study groups would be great for that class. It's not as much problem solving but it's more of a qualitative understanding of things other than coding. 
",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False
294,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,POS," No. In my opinion, that doesn't affect the collaboration because people are aware of what they do, they know the choices they make. And if they intend to copy verbatim for something then they chose to do that and they're well aware of it. But you know, if others are hard about that then that can be avoided. It's not, I don't think it's something unconscious. If it is coincidental, it's very hard to prove but yeah, it's not something I would say, ""It just happens.""

In instance like, you can help someone solve a problem and go through a problem but as long as it's not explicitly looking at the code and looking at the thing, it should be fine. Because I remember a friend of mine, last semester, he gave somebody the code and then it was really bad.

296,Joe,CompS,male,Freshman,No,POS," Probably, it's a small thing, but it's probably my favorite thing. So far, it's probably just the overall structure, the classes, the exams for 201 and 202 where it's like, they're not hard, they're pretty…they're not simple but they're just like, you have to know everything and it feels like you're learning a lot from the exams and you're preparing for the exams to study for them. I just really like the overall structure for those two classes. 
",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False
297,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEU," I know one way to fix that is to, on the exam, evaluate everything but you curve the exam because not…so the problem is, students may not study a couple things that they covered between the midterm and the final. Let's assume the final isn't cumulative. So, if they review only certain things for that second half then they're going to miss something on the final exam. So if you evaluate everything on the final exam that's in that second half, you won't worry about that. And then the exam would have to be curved. 
",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True
298,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEU," I would suggest it because if you're covering so much and you only have a limited time to do it then many…there's a possibility of students not finishing the exam but it avoids the problem of, ""I didn't study for this."" 
",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True
299,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEU," But one thing I wouldn't change is the amount of, I want to say opportunities, but there's a lot of events I go on in the department and there's a lot of advertising for it. So that's one thing I would keep, like the research seminars that happen in this very room, those are great. 
",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
300,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEG," But actually, one thing that I would change about this department is having more full-time faculty because I noticed that a lot of the teachers are adjuncts. And the drawback to that is that most of the time, they're only here for two days a week and some students need more than that and some students can't even make their office hours when they're on campus. So, if there are more full-time faculty here then it's more likely that students will be able to use them as a resource.

301,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,POS," There's a lot of research opportunities, both on campus and at other universities, but I would say that a lot of people in the computing field itself. So, it's not just computer science but just very broadly, people are unaware about opportunities that are outside of industry. So, a lot of people don't know about grad school in general and they just want to take on a job right after graduation. And I would say over time or eventually that's gonna… it's already a norm but it's gonna be very common that it's not gonna really appeal to people or companies actually because if you have thousands of people in computer science coming out every year and it just becomes a regular pipeline for people. 
",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False
302,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEU," So I would say, people need to know more about what they can do after college because it's not just software engineering that's out there for a company. There's a lot of other things like research, grad school as well as post-bach opportunities, just for examples. But of course, in the end, it's their own choice. But I would say, again, the exposure factor is important for this. 
",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False
303,Joe,CompS,male,Freshman,No,NEG," I would say for the people who are just starting out, more exposure to different aspects of computer science and more exposure to see what things can they do with it because a lot of times with 201 and 202, it's very, I would say tight in what you have to know, what you have to learn. So, I can see a lot of people getting bored with it or they're just not exposed to certain outside opportunities with relation to computer science. 
",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
304,Tom,CompS,male,Senior,No,NEU," That's true. The intro classes here are very programming focused so maybe that could change. Instead of just having programming projects and learning a programming language, it would be more about both the opportunities in the field and other CS concepts that are not programmed because maybe people don't want to just learn programming their first year.

306,Blue1,InfoS,male,Not Specified,No,NEG," Okay. So, some perceptions I've seen or at least heard from employers is that they don't really regard Information Systems as seriously as they do CompSci. Most of the employers, when they come to the career fair at UMBC, they're looking for the CompSci people because they know that they're stuck in a lab, they've been doing code and they, they'd give the internships to them, no strings attached. With Information Systems, you kinda have to talk your way in a little bit more and talk about your skills, your resume and talk about what your programming skills are. Yeah, I've had that in my personal experience. When I've talked to employers, you know, they're welcome to CompSci and IS. But most of them from what I've heard from other people, there's a little bit of a bias towards CompSci.

307,Blue2,InfoS,male,Not Specified,No,NEU," I think I could kind of add to that. So computer science seems to be like the hot commodity now and that's why a lot of people are graduating towards those two words.

308,Blue2,InfoS,male,Not Specified,No,NEU," Not really. I think that that as students, we all go through the same pain, just a little bit different. Everyone deals with their own struggles with programming languages or whatnot but there is, I guess to say, there's community in misery when it comes to that but there's no tension between me and my fellow CompSci majors or between me and my IS majors.

310,Blue2,InfoS,male,Not Specified,No,NEG," So, I think the bias really comes from the fact that CS is more math-based so a lot of people think that if you're doing IS, you're not good at math for some odd reason. So, yeah.

Because I mean, a lot of kids who look like me, who are black, they don’t have the same opportunities. So, with the resources I've been given, I feel an obligation as a middle-class citizen to at least put out a hand up, maybe not a handout but hand up to help people.

So, a lot of people have different interests and within IS, because it's interdisciplinary, it allows you to be more accepted within that community no matter what your interests may be. So I think that's like the best advantage you have going into it.

359,Blue2,InfoS,male,Not Specified,No,NEG," So yeah, I think because of that there are some losses in translation between the students and the faculty when it comes to teaching certain concepts because you can't really communicate on a level where everybody can understand.

364,Blue1,InfoS,male,Not Specified,No,NEG," Yeah. I feel it's the problem across a lot of different classes or even with… Maybe this is in different colleges but just in general, with classes at UMBC, there's a lot of students who are really engaged, who really wanna talk with the professor.

366,Blue2,InfoS,male,Not Specified,No,NEU," Yeah, I figured out that I do tend to focus more when I study individually rather than when I'm in a group because subjects and conversations tend to get tangential and we run off course, and we start talking about different things.

It's not their thing. If someone wants to choose something else or if they eventually come back to CompSci or Information Systems later on in their careers then that's what they're gonna do.

So, to start off with getting more feedback from different cultures and different backgrounds like you are now which is good.

375,Blue1,InfoS,male,Not Specified,No,NEU," I think it might help, in the same vein of like a bottoms-up approach, is to have representatives from each, from as many, I guess, intersecting identities as possible present at outreach events for students who are interested in UMBC. And following that orientation, when it comes to like talking about your academic toolkit, instead of having, like a faculty member present, have a student present who is female or of another gender identity. Present them and then just continually show that there's not, that you can find yourself here in this department.
